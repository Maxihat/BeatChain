* Drink and food tokens are used as payment token for buying drinks and food at bars, restaurants and events. 

* Drink tokens are also perfect for cash control at events, fairs, festivals, parties, performances, sports clubs and other occasions.

* Environmentally friendly and cost effective as a result of being available to use them in every event worldwide.
